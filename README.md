# Coursera-Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is the final course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

Merges the two datasets
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy_results.txt.
